# horrorinteractive
Horror Interactive is a text-based storytelling game based on the classic Choose Your Adventure stories.

This project was created mainly to test what I have learned so far, as well as to prepare myself for bigger projects in the future.

I may update this project with more story options and/or features at some point if I think of ways I can expand upon it as I continue to learn.

Feel free to reuse any aspects of this project for your own purposes.

Thanks for reading and thanks for playing!
