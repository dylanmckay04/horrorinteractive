# horrorinteractive
Horror Interactive is a text-based storytelling game based on the classic Choose Your Adventure stories.

This project was created mainly to test what I have learned so far, as well as to serve as a starting point for my development portfolio.

I plan on updating and expanding this game with new story paths and features as I continue to learn.

Feel free to reuse any parts of this code for your own purposes.

Thanks for reading and thanks for playing!
